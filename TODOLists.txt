Time : Night Mar 31 ~ Apr 01 2022 {
	- TODO : Find out the reason of different ORB matchings from cpu to gpu;
		(AROUND 650 matches from cpu but around 200 from gpu);
	= Decided to use non-cuda descriptor brute force matcher (knnmatch)
	= Now has a stable result
	- TODO : Find good way to perform sgbm;
	= Just used cuda sgm
}

Time : Afternoon Apr 04 2022 {
	- TODO : SPLIT stereo vslam into cuda version and mac version
	- DONE
	- TODO : USE KEYFRAMES THAT WILL BE USED FOR GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
	- DONE : REPLACED the original 20 frames length of sliding window sub global optimization by global optimization of key frames
	- "  " : -> ACTUALLY using both SLIDING WINDOW on both local frames and global key frames
	- TODO : CHANGE KEYFRAME AND KEYFRAMEPTS storings from shared_ptr to weak_ptr 
	- DONE : CHANGED all key frame and key frameptr storings to weak_ptr and changed all recurring functions

	- TODO : ADAPT the newest visual_stereo_slam_demo_2_mac to visual_stereo_slam_demo_2

	- TODO : REFINE display class and member functions

	- TODO : MAYBE try to make multiple displays

	- TODO : TRY SIMULATING MPC by predicting like 10 steps into the future by using the car model

	- TODO : ADD DETR OBJECT DETECTION, WHEN DETECTED MASK THE AREA THEN EXCLUDE KPS FROM THAT AREA
}

Time : Afternoon Apr 05 2022 {
	- DONE PRIOR :
		Adapted detr to c++ (mistake was in preprocessing)
	- TODO : CLEAN the detr python code
	- TODO : REFINE display class and member functions
	- TODO : MAYBE try to make multiple displays
	
	- TODO : PREPARE loading bboxes into extracting features and spawning in display.
						MAYBE use masking for extracting features
						BUT still need to estimate how close the car is.
						NEED to think about this (maybe all we need to do is scaling)

	- TODO : WRITE functions in template so that I can adapt both GpuMat and Mat
	- TODO : CLEAN print functions
	- ALMOST DONE 
	- TODO : CHANGE creating g2o::SparseOptimizer everytime
						just make it such that the new vertices and edges are added each time
}

Time : Afternoon Apr 18 2022 : First day of work for project in US {
	- TODO : FINISH estimating the location of the car : Main edits are in frame.cpp 
	- TODO : Render the car
	- DONE : Git repository is online keep adding new files for the project (ONLY finished files will be uploaded)
}
